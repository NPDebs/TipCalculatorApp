An app that helps the user calculate the total amount a service (meal) costs.

It doesn't take a math genius to figure out what 10% of $1,000 is. However, meals involving large orders and multiple persons may require extra brain muscle.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...TipCalc22!! (from crowd import cheers)

This user-friendly app allows the user(s) input the total amount for a meal and the restaurant's standard tip percentage.
From these details, the total amount to be paid is calculated (unless the meal is free, obviously).

Here's the really fun part! This app promotes equity and justice by splitting the bill equally among the eaters.
Using a tiny conditional statement, the app ensures at least one lucky fellow pays for the (happy) meal.

I know you're eager to give it a try. So, follow the link to the hosted site => https://npdebs.github.io/TipCalculatorApp/
